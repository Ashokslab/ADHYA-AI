The Birth of Lord Ganesha
A long time ago, on Mount Kailash, Goddess Parvati was preparing for her bath. She wanted someone to guard the entrance while she bathed. So, she took some turmeric paste, molded it into the shape of a boy, and breathed life into him. Thus, a beautiful child was born—Ganesha!

Parvati was overjoyed and said, "You are my son. Stand at the entrance and do not let anyone in." The obedient Ganesha stood guard.

The Mighty Clash: Ganesha vs. Shiva
Soon, Lord Shiva, Parvati’s husband, returned home. As he tried to enter, little Ganesha stopped him. "My mother has ordered that no one shall enter," he said firmly.

Shiva, surprised by this little boy's courage, warned him, "I am the Lord of the Universe! Let me pass!"

But Ganesha refused to move.

This angered Shiva, and he sent his ganas (divine warriors) to remove the boy. However, Ganesha, being strong and fearless, defeated them all! Seeing this, even Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma were astonished.

Finally, Shiva, in his rage, lifted his mighty trident and struck off Ganesha’s head!

The Birth of Ganesha, the Elephant-Headed God
When Parvati came out and saw her son lifeless, she broke down in grief. "You have killed my son! I will destroy the world if he is not brought back!" she wept.

Realizing his mistake, Shiva consoled her and ordered his ganas, "Find the head of the first living being you see and bring it to me."

The first creature they found was a baby elephant. They brought its head, and Shiva placed it on Ganesha’s body, bringing him back to life!

Parvati embraced her son, and Shiva declared, "From today, you will be known as Ganesha, the leader of my ganas. You shall be worshipped before all gods."

Why Ganesha is Worshipped First
Since then, before starting any new journey, people worship Lord Ganesha to remove obstacles and bring success. His wisdom, strength, and devotion to his mother make him a beloved god.

And that is how Lord Ganesha became the Elephant-headed God of Wisdom and Success!
