# Mahabharata - Part 1: The Beginning

## Introduction: The Epic of Dharma
The Mahabharata, one of the greatest epics of all time, was composed by **Sage Vyasa** and written by **Lord Ganesha**. It is a tale of **dharma (righteousness), karma (action), and destiny**. The story revolves around the **Kuru dynasty**, the conflict between the **Pandavas and Kauravas**, and the **great war of Kurukshetra**.

## The Curse & Birth of Vyasa
Long before the Mahabharata began, **King Shantanu** ruled the Kuru dynasty. He fell in love with **Ganga**, the river goddess. Ganga agreed to marry him under one condition: he must never question her actions. Over time, she gave birth to **seven sons**, but drowned each one in the river. When she tried to drown the eighth son, Shantanu stopped her, breaking his promise. Ganga revealed that their sons were the **Vasus, celestial beings cursed to be born as mortals**. She spared the last one, **Devavrata**, and left, raising him in the heavens.

## Devavrata Becomes Bhishma
Years later, Devavrata returned as a mighty warrior. Shantanu fell in love with **Satyavati**, a fisherwoman, but her father refused the marriage unless her son would inherit the throne. To fulfill his father’s wish, **Devavrata took a vow of lifelong celibacy** and unwavering loyalty to the throne. This incredible sacrifice earned him the name **Bhishma**, meaning "the one of terrible vow."

## The Birth of Pandu, Dhritarashtra, and Vidura
Satyavati bore **two sons**, but both died young. To continue the Kuru lineage, Sage Vyasa was called upon to perform **Niyoga**, an ancient custom where a sage fathers children for a widowed queen.

- **Dhritarashtra**: Born blind due to his mother Ambika closing her eyes in fear.
- **Pandu**: Born pale due to his mother Ambalika’s fright.
- **Vidura**: Born wise and righteous but not eligible for the throne as he was the son of a maid.

## The Birth of the Pandavas and Kauravas
Pandu, cursed to die if he ever engaged in intimacy, renounced the throne and lived in the forest with his wives, **Kunti and Madri**. Kunti, blessed with a divine mantra, invoked the gods to give her sons:

- **Yudhishthira** (Dharma’s son) – The eldest, known for his righteousness.
- **Bhima** (Vayu’s son) – Mighty and strong, with the power of ten thousand elephants.
- **Arjuna** (Indra’s son) – The greatest warrior and master archer.
- **Nakula & Sahadeva** (Ashwini twins’ sons) – Skilled in swordsmanship and wisdom.

Meanwhile, **Gandhari**, Dhritarashtra’s wife, gave birth to **100 sons**, the eldest being **Duryodhana**, who would become the Pandavas’ greatest rival.

## Conclusion: The Seeds of Rivalry
From their childhood, the Pandavas and Kauravas competed fiercely. Duryodhana, envious of the Pandavas' strength and popularity, began plotting against them. This deep-seated rivalry would eventually lead to the **Great War of Kurukshetra**, but destiny had much more in store before that battle could take place.
